# Contact Lens Wear Tracker


### Project Overview

This app is a relatively simple app that will allow the user to keep track of their contact lens wear.  The user can keep track of their daily wear as well as the wear of their last 5 pairs of contact lens.  The app will automatically calculate the average wear time (in days) every time the user changes their contacts and begins using a new pair.

All the information that the user inputs/generates will be stored in the Shared Preferences on the users device.  This app does not use a database because the amount of information generated/saved is small and finite.
